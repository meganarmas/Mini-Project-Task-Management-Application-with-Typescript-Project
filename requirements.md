Project Requirements
 ðŸ’¡ Note: We've already developed key functionalities for our Task Management project in the "Module 9: CSS Framework" mini-project. To save time and maintain consistency, consider reusing the Bootstrap classes and design as a foundation. This approach ensures a unified and efficient codebase, making it easier to integrate with the React TypeScript new features into the existing solution.

Task Management Features:
Task Dashboard Page:
Implement a dashboard interface for managing tasks, including features like task lists, creation, editing, and deletion.
Task Details Page:
Design a detailed view for individual tasks, displaying task information and allowing users to modify task details.
Task Creation and Editing Pages:
Develop forms for creating and editing tasks, incorporating TypeScript types for data validation and error handling.
Authentication and Authorization Pages:
Implement user authentication and authorization pages, including registration, login, and password reset functionalities.
TypeScript Integration:
Utilize TypeScript to enforce type safety and enhance code readability and maintainability throughout the project.
Define TypeScript interfaces for data shapes and enforce type checking in React components and utility functions.
State Management with Typed Hooks:
Utilize React's useState and useReducer hooks with TypeScript to manage application state effectively.
Context API for Global State Management:
Implement the Context API in React with TypeScript for managing global application state and sharing data between components.
Authentication and Authorization with Auth0:
Integrate Auth0 authentication services into the application for secure user authentication and authorization.
Configure TypeScript types for Auth0 user data and authentication tokens.
Error Handling and Validation:
Implement error handling and form validation using TypeScript types and React components to provide a seamless user experience.
GitHub Repository:
Create a GitHub repository for the project and commit code regularly.
Submission
Upon completing the project, submit your code and video, including all source code files, and the README.md file in your GitHub repository to your instructor or designated platform.
